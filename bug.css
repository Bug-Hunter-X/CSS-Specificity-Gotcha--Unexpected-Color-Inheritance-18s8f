The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors and the cascading order:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.special {
  color: red;
}

.special div {
  color: green;
}

<div class="special"></div>
```

The unexpected behavior: The text within the div element will be green, not blue or red. Why? Because the selector `.special div` is more specific than `div` and `.special` individually, even though it is lower in the CSS file.
