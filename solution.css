The solution involves either understanding and leveraging CSS specificity or restructuring the CSS rules:

**Solution 1 (Understanding Specificity):**

The selector `.special div` is more specific than both `div` and `.special`.  Specificity is determined by a point system: 

* Inline styles: 1000 points
* IDs: 100 points
* Classes, attributes and pseudo-classes: 10 points
* Elements and pseudo-elements: 1 point

`.special div` has a higher specificity due to the combination of class and element selector.  Understanding this is key to resolving the conflict.

**Solution 2 (Restructuring CSS):**

Rearrange the CSS rules to prioritize the desired style.  By placing the rule with the highest specificity (or the desired outcome) later in the stylesheet, it overrides previous declarations:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.special {
  color: red;
}

.special div {
  color: green;
}
```

In `solution.css`, we haven't changed the specificity, but we will change the order of the rules to prioritize a specific rule (e.g. making the text red).  This solution highlights the importance of CSS order and demonstrates a different approach to solving the issue:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.special {
  color: red;
}

.special div {
  color: green;
}
```
